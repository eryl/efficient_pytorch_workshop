# Efficient PyTorch workshop material

This repository contains materials from a lightweight workshop on efficient pytorch. Mostly it centered on converting a model
to deepspeed but also contains some examples of how pipelining of batch transfers to GPU _could_ work (even though 
it doesn't).

Presentation material for the workshop can be found in `slides/`, which give more context for the code.
